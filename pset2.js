PROBLEM 1:

In this problem, you will be downloading some files from online, then creating a custom project with git initialized. You will then one by one structure the files and make commits to git as needed.

1. Download this repository from the homepage by clicking "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP". You will be using the files from the /stuff directory.
2. Once the repository has been downloaded, go ahead and unzip it.

3. Achieve the following structure ONLY using command line:

~/Desktop/pset2
    /assets
        /images
            amazon.jpg
            facebook.png
            move facebook.png c:\Users\Yang\Blackfolder\PCNWLab-Command-Line\assets\images //window cmd 
            google.jpg
            twitter.png
            mv twitter.png cd ../assets/images/ //Mac cmd
        /memes
            meme.jpg
            mv meme.jpg cd ../assets/memes/
        /src
            foo.js
            app.js
            hello.html
               mv foo.js cd ../assets/src/
                mv app.js cd ../assets/src/
                 mv hello.html cd ../assets/src/

4. Open `hello.html` using a code editor and change "SOME_CLASS" to "Full Stack: Nights & Weekends". Save it.
code hello.html
type "FSNW" in plcae "SC"
5. You should have the following commits:
- git initialized
cd assets
git init
- added app.js
git add .
- added hello.html
- created assets directory
- added all images & memes
